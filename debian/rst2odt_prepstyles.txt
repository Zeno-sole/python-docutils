Synopsis
========
**rst2odt_prepstyles** *FILE*

Description
===========

**rst2odt**\(1) uses a stylesheet file as a template for the ODT files it
creates.  The stock **styles.odt** file shipped with it comes without page
dimensions.  When **rst2odt** is run and detects that there no paper size is
given in the stylesheet, it is automatically determined using
**paperconf**\(1).

When editing stylesheets with OpenOffice.org Writer (or similar programs), the
resulting files always carry a page size.  **rst2odt** respects this setting
and ensures that documents processed with custom stylesheets look the same
regardless of the host it is running on.  If you want to get the original
behavior, i.e. a system-dependent paper size, you can run
**rst2odt_prepstyles** over your custom stylesheet.  Remember to re-run the
command whenever you change the file with a word processor.
